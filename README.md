## Overview

This project is a currency exchange rate application developed using React.js and Tailwind CSS. It fetches real-time currency exchange rates from an external API and allows users to convert between different currencies.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Fetched real-time currency exchange rates from an external API to provide up-to-date conversion rates.
- **Custom Hook**: Developed a custom React hook to manage currency data fetching and state management efficiently.
- **Swap Functionality**: Implemented a swap feature to toggle the values and currency options between input fields dynamically.
- **Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS**: Designed and styled the application using Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and modern user interface.
- **State Management**: Utilized `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side-effect handling.
- **User Interaction**: Created an intuitive interface allowing users to input currency values and select currency options easily.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensured optimal performance and quick responsiveness through efficient component design and state management.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling for API calls and user inputs to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Documentation**: Documented the codebase and provided clear comments for maintainability and future enhancements.
